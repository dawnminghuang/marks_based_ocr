	Annote = {shares a lot in common with our shape-free approach.  They make use of an ensemble of simple methods that look at v/p ratio (how many partial assignments match valid words in lexicon, versus total words containing those assigned clusters).

Results are reported for business letters from the UNLV set, more than half achieve decent word accuracy (median is about 80%), but the other half fail (around 20% word accuracy).},

	Annote = {Gets connected components of training documents, throwing out those
	with a height that is too small or too large, 
	
	rescaled to a uniform size (30x40 pixels).
	
	Uses simple clustering based on Hamming distance from training data
	then takes the average image as a template
	
	(after thresholding pixels that aren't on at least half the time).
	 
	
	Throws out clusters that don't have at least 3 elements, then attempts
	to find matches of the templates in the
	
	test set of documents.  Classifies script of document based on the
	number of matching templates.
	
	
	Results are reasonable, though the documents in the test and train
	set are often separate pages of the
	
	same document.  Has problems with unseen fonts (ex italicized roman)},
