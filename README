1. INSTALLING
-------------

1.1 - Requirements
------------------

* Matlab 7 or higher  (earlier versions won't work due to use of imview and
                       find(...'first') etc.)

1.2 - Notes
-----------

* Copy all files (and subdirs) in this directory to some location on the users
  computer (note this location -- we'll denote it INS_PATH).

* Add the following lines to your ~/matlab/startup.m (or type it from the
  Matlab command prompt):

  global MOCR_PATH;
  MOCR_PATH = 'INS_PATH';
  addpath(MOCR_PATH);
  marks_ocr_init;


(where INS_PATH is replaced by the actual path to where the files and subdirs
 were installed)


2. Configuration
----------------

Typically, modifiable parameters are found at the top of key files before
being passed on to other functions as neccessary.  Descriptions of each 
parameter are located within such a file and sensible defaults are already
defined.

* for clustering and connected components, see cluster/cluster_comps.m

* for line finding, see util/get_lines.m

* ...


3. Running
----------
* There are 3 main tasks: creating training data, clustering components of 
  file images and constructing a language model from them, and performing ocr
  on lines of training data, given a constructed language model.

* To create new training cases, the following commands are useful:

* ...
